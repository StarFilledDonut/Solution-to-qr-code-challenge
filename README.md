## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Practiced the use of Flexbox in my code.

```css
#qrSection {
  background-color: white;

  width: 300px;
  height: auto;

  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;

  padding: 1em;
  padding-bottom: 2em;
  border-radius: 16px;
  margin: 13% 0;
}
```

And the how to control the user interaction with my links.

```html
<a href="https://github.com/StarFilledDonut" target="_blank">Kelly</a>.
```

### Continued development

I will continue to learn and practice the concepts of Flexbox in my projects as well as start to learn the use of Grids.

### Useful resources

- [HTML <a> target Attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_target.asp) - For defining the interaction of the user with my links.
